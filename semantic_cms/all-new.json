    "content": "<p>I write hundreds of words every day on my phone. At first it was just emails and text messages, but now it's also Slack conversations, notes and countless of messages of various sizes and shapes in all sorts of messaging apps. And yet, there's one thing I've refrained from doing so far \u2014 writing TechCrunch posts on my phone. But this is also changing.</p><p>Earlier this week, small indie development shop The Soulmen released <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.ulyssesapp.com/\">Ulysses for iPhone</a>. Ulysses is a popular writing app on OS X and iPad. I've played with the app on my Mac in the past. But I couldn't really consider using it seriously because there was one missing element \u2014 an iPhone app.</p><p>Ulysses is a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\">Markdown</a> text editor for small and big projects. It works quite well for anything between a blog post and a novel. And Ulysses is also the kind of apps we need on iOS. It's an expensive $25 app that provides nearly all the features of its desktop equivalent. In other words, it's a serious app to do serious work with a clear business model. And of course, everything stays in sync between the different versions of the apps.</p><p>And this is key to understanding how Ulysses stands out. I can now start a draft on my phone, edit it on my iPad, give it a final look on my Mac and publish it on this website. I've already written a handful of drafts in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://simplenote.com/\">Simplenote</a> on my iPhone in the past. But this is a much more streamlined process.</p><p>Ulysses is a polished iOS app that lets you write, organize and export your writing in different formats. It's a well-designed, versatile app that is worth trying if you write every day. It competes with many other apps, such as <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://omz-software.com/editorial/\">Editorial</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://1writerapp.com/\">1Writer</a> on iOS, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php\">Scrivener</a> on OS X.</p><p>I wanted to take Ulysses one step further and make it work seamlessly with our CMS \u2014 WordPress. I started with Ulysses for OS X. With a few clicks, I can now run a Ruby script that sends my draft to our backend so that I just have to review it, tweak a few options and publish it.</p><p>But what about iOS? You can't do that on iOS right? Feeling inspired by iOS automation wizard <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/viticci\">Federico Viticci</a>, I tried to recreate my OS X script on iOS. And sure enough, automation app <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://workflow.is/\">Workflow</a> lets you do that just fine. I can now post to WordPress from Ulysses and auto-fill the headline, tags and excerpt using <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://workflow.is/workflows/39513979b5924c0e998fe79bd5d42715\">this workflow</a>. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://workflow.is/workflows/5d4bc5cb5ad84b2580f3fc75978394cb\">Another workflow</a> lets me upload images to WordPress from iOS.</p><p>I've already written a few posts using this process and it's been even more useful than I expected. I already spend so much time typing on my iPhone that I can type nearly as fast on my iPhone as on my Mac. But in many cases, it's much more convenient to write on my phone. In fact, this post was written on my phone.</p><p>For demo purpose of Semantic CMS copied from <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2016/03/13/ulysses-for-iphone-makes-me-consider-writing-articles-on-my-phone/\" target=\"_blank\">TechCrunch.com</a>, I am not the author.<br></p>",

    "content": "<p>Encryption with a backdoor accessible to very few in important situations is what President Barack Obama says he suspects is the answer to the digital privacy versus security debate. That contradicts the position of many in the security industry who believe that would inevitability lead to abuses of such a backdoor.</p><p>While speaking today at SXSW, Obama said he could not comment directly on the Apple-San Bernardino shooter case, but gave these remarks on the larger issue surrounding the <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/tag/apple-vs-fbi/\">FBI\u2019s ongoing fight with Apple</a> about penetrating encryption.</p><p>Here are Obama\u2019s full remarks on the matter:</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\u201cAll of us value our privacy, and this is a society that is built on a Constitution and a Bill Of Rights and a healthy skepticism about overreaching government power. Before smartphones were invented and to this day, if there is probable cause to think that you have abducted a child, or that you are engaging in a terrorist plot, or you are guilty of some serious crime, law enforcement can appear at your doorstep and say we have a warrant to search your home and can go into your bedroom and into your bedroom drawers to rifle through your underwear to see if there\u2019s any evidence of wrongdoing.</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">And we agree on that because we recognize that just like all of our other rights, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, etc, that <strong>there are</strong><strong> going to be some constraints imposed to ensure we are safe</strong>, secure and living in a civilized society.</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">Technology is evolving so rapidly that new questions are being asked, and I am of the view that <strong>there are very real reasons why we want to make sure the government can not just wily-nilly get into everyone\u2019s iPhones or smartphones</strong> that are full of very personal information or very personal data.\u201d</p><p>Obama went on to note that concerns about the government encroaching on privacy were heightened by the Snowden revelations, but also joked that TV crime shows have exaggerated the powers of law enforcement. But getting serious again, he said:</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">\u201cWhat makes it even more complicated is that <strong>we also want really strong encryption</strong> because part of us preventing terrorism or preventing people from disrupting the financial system or our air traffic control system or a whole other set of systems that are increasingly digitized, is that hackers, state or non-state, can\u2019t get in there and mess around.</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">So we have two values, both of which are important.</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">And the question we now have to ask is if technologically it is possible to make an impenetrable device or system where the encryption is so strong that there is no key there, there\u2019s no door at all? And how do we apprehend the child pornographer? How do we solve or disrupt a terrorist plot? What mechanisms do we have available that even do simple things like tax enforcement? Because if you can\u2019t crack that at all, and government can\u2019t get in, then everybody\u2019s walking around with a Swiss bank account in their pocket. <strong>So there has to be some some concession to the need to be able to get to that information somehow.\u201d</strong></p><p>Rather than only give his own perspective, Obama acknowledged the risks of a backdoor being misused, but said those risks can be mitigated with the help of the tech community.<br></p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">Now what folks who are on the encryption side will argue is any key whatsoever, even if it starts off as just being directed at one device, could end up being used on any device. That\u2019s just the nature of these systems.That is a technical question. I am not a software engineer. It is, I think, technically true, but i think it it can be overstated.<br></p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">So the question now becomes, we as a society, setting aside the specific case between the FBI and Apple, setting aside the commercial interests, the concerns about what the Chinese government could do with this even if we trust the US government, setting aside all these questions, we\u2019re going to have to make some decisions about how we balance these respective risks. I\u2019ve got a bunch of smart people sitting there talking about it, thinking about it. We have engaged the tech community aggressively to help solve this problem.</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">My conclusion so far is that <strong>you cannot take an absolutist view on this</strong>. So if your argument is strong encryption no matter what, and we can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t make black boxes, that I do not think strikes the balances we\u2019ve struck for 200 or 300 years and it\u2019s fetishizing our phones above every other value. And that can\u2019t be the right answer. <strong>I suspect the answer will come down to how can we make sure the encryption is as strong as possible, the key as strong as possible, it\u2019s accessible by the smallest number of people possible, for a subset of issues that we agree are important.</strong> How we design that is not something I have the expertise to do.</p><p>Obama concluded by urging us to address this problem now in a rational way rather than waiting for a catastrophe to force us into clumsy action.<br></p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">I am way on the civil liberties side of this thing\u2026I anguish a lot over the decisions we make in terms of how we keep this country safe, and I am not interested in overdrawing the values that have made us an exceptional and great nation simply for expediency. But the dangers are real. Maintaining law and order in a civilized society is important. Protecting our kids is important. And so I would just caution against an absolutist perspective on this.<br></p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">Because we make compromises all the time. You know, I haven\u2019t flown commercial in a while. But my understanding is that it\u2019s not great fun going through security. But we make the concession. It\u2019s a big intrusion on our privacy, but we recognize it as important. We have stops for drunk drivers. It\u2019s an intrusion but we think it\u2019s the right thing to do.</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"><strong>And this notion that somehow our data is different and can be walled off from those other trade-offs we make, I believe is incorrect.</strong> We do have to make sure, given the power of the Internet and how much our lives are digitized, that it is narrow, and is constrained, and that there\u2019s oversight. I\u2019m confident that this is something that we can solve.</p><p style=\"margin-left: 20px;\">But we\u2019re going to need the tech community, the software designers, the people who care deeply about this stuff to help us solve it. Because what will happen is if everyone goes to their respective corners and the tech community says \u2018Either we have strong, perfect encryption or else it\u2019s Big Brother and an Orwellian world,\u2019 <strong>what you\u2019ll find is that after something really bad happens, the politics of this will swing, and they will become sloppy, and rushed, and it will go through Congress in ways that have not been thought through. And then you really will have dangers to our civil liberties</strong> because the people who understand this best, who care most about privacy and civil liberties, will have disengaged or taken a position that is not sustainable for the general public as a whole over time.</p><p>Obama essentially played both sides of the argument, identifying the need for privacy, but admitting that some limitations are required to keep Americans safe.</p><p>Pushing for backdoors goes against the perspective of many tech insiders and security advocates. Weakening core security of phones could make them vulnerable if the backdoor were ever misused by the government or stolen by hackers or a foreign state. Yet refusing to compromise encryption in any way now could lead to disastrous legislation in the future. Expect this to be a debate that will rage for years to come.</p><p>For demo purpose of Semantic CMS copied from <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2016/03/11/obama-says-we-dont-want-government-to-look-into-everyones-phones-willy-nilly/\" target=\"_blank\">TechCrunch.com</a>, I am not the author.<br></p>",

    "content": "<p>Wikipedia today launched an upgraded version of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wikipedia-mobile/id324715238?mt=8\">its iOS application</a> aimed at helping users better discover content matching their own interests, including both articles and images. In addition, the app has been optimized for Apple\u2019s newer OS and latest iPhones (6s and 6s Plus) with support for 3D Touch and Spotlight Search integrations.</p><p>This is the latest in a series of efforts from the organization to make its mobile application something users turn to for more than everyday fact-checking purposes.</p><p>In the past, those efforts have included the rollout of more utilitarian features like <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/31/wikipedia-revamps-its-ios-app-with-offline-access-support-for-editing-while-on-the-go/\">offline access and mobile editing, </a>as well as an experiment with <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/04/15/wikipedias-new-ios-app-sees-an-improved-design-adds-social-features-with-shareable-fact-cards/\">going social by way of shareable \u201cfact cards</a>,\u201d  which were added last year. (That feature is still supported, but has been made less prominent. You now have to select text to \u201cshare a fact.\u201d)</p><p>In the latest <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wikipedia-mobile/id324715238?mt=8\">version</a>, Wikipedia focuses more heavily on finding interesting things to read and personalization. That is, it presents users with a new \u201cExplore\u201d feed that showcases a combination of the top read articles, the featured article and featured picture of the day, random articles, and nearby articles, in addition to those recommended based on how you\u2019ve been using the app previously. These latter suggestions will be related to what you read on the app, the organization says.</p><p>In addition, the update includes support for navigating using multi-touch gestures (including swipe, tap and 3D Touch), as well as 3D Touch from the app\u2019s icon on the homescreen. This will let you open search, read a random article, see nearby articles, or continue reading your latest. Another iOS-specific feature, Handoff, is now supported in this release, too.<br></p><p>Finally, a feature that you save articles to read later, which are also available offline, arrived along with improvements to image galleries and tools to more easily share articles via social media or email.</p><p>The extent any of these changes \u2013 or those in the past \u2013 are having on Wikipedia\u2019s traction on iOS is less certain. The app remains top-ranked in the \u201cReference\u201d category on the App Store, where it\u2019s usually in the top 15 or 20 (Though, lately it dropped a bit to the 30\u2019s.) However, it\u2019s certainly not one of the most popular \u201cOverall\u201d apps on the iPhone, despite its brand-name awareness.</p><p>The problem is that many people don\u2019t think of Wikipedia as a place they want to explore, but rather a place to look something up. And the fact that its web content has been surfaced through Apple\u2019s Spotlight Search since iOS 8 likely satisfies most in need of a quick fact check. Wikipedia is still trying to find the sweet spot in terms of making its iOS app something that would be more regularly launched, but it\u2019s not a certainty that simply rolling out a better \u201cexplore\u201d feed will do the trick.</p><p>That said, the app is well-designed and highly polished, and worth the download for those who would rather learn something in their free time rather than goof off on Snapchat or Vine. The updated Wikipedia app is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wikipedia-mobile/id324715238?mt=8\">live now on the iTunes App Store</a>.</p><p>For demo purpose of Semantic CMS copied from <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2016/03/10/wikipedias-new-ios-app-focuses-on-discovery-personalization/\" target=\"_blank\">TechCrunch.com</a>, I am not the author.<br></p>",

Comparably speaking, this represents just over 10 percent of total .com registrations, more than 50 percent of the total .net registrations and 30 percent more than total .org registrations.</p><p>While these numbers may not be a surprise to some, they certainly prove the Not-Com revolution (a term coined by Jeff Davidoff, CMO of Donuts, and the largest applicant for new domain-name extensions) is certainly making waves.</p><p>From Lady Gaga (bornthisway.foundation) to Oprah (wherearetheynow.buzz) to Slack (slack.help), thousands of companies have adopted the new domains. Some use one as a primary domain, others for email; others are embracing the very tangible, visual marketing advantage of these.</p><p>Deadpool uses a URL shortener from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://bit.ly/\">bit.ly</a> to promote an external link. In theory this works, because Bitly is a well-trusted brand. However, Deadpool is missing out on a very real opportunity for consistent brand experience by using a custom URL shortener \u2014 maybe deadpool.link, dp.link or something that\u2019s more the Deadpool brand than someone else\u2019s.</p><p>Bitly has even started embracing the adoption of Branded Short Domains under their Bitly Enterprise product offering. For example, ATTN.com is a highly popular news site with more than 1.6 million Facebook likes. However, if you look at ATTN\u2019s Twitter <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/attn\">feed</a>, you\u2019ll see they use attn.link as a URL shortener.</p><p>Now, visit ATTN.link and you\u2019ll clearly see that the domain name is part of Bitly\u2019s Branded URL enterprise solution product, where Bitly claims users can experience up to a 34 percent CTR increase simply by changing the name of their URL shortener (read <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bitly.com/pages/resources/casestudies/increasing-engagement-the-power-of-a-branded-short-domain?\">Bitly\u2019s case study</a>).</p><p>For brand builders, these custom URL shorteners provide an extremely low-cost solution for maintaining brand consistency. You may have to sacrifice a character or two, but Twitter has discussed <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2016/01/05/information-density/\">expanding the number of characters</a> in future tweets.</p><p>From generic extensions like .help and .link to targeted extensions like .movie and .style, brands may do well to remember they often have the power to control anything left of the dot.</p><p>For those who doubted new domain name extensions, it may be time to widen your perspective and possibly even your ROI \u2014 which is, after all, every company\u2019s dream.</p>",

Specifically, the fact that they often had to use multiple tools that didn\u2019t necessarily talk to each other meant that every time designers wanted to change something in their mockups, they had to go back and change it manually (and maybe numerous times to account for different screen sizes).</p><p><img src=\"/media/2016/3/14/adobexd_hero.png\"></p><p>With this new tool, designers can quickly change back and forth between the artboards designers create in the \u201cdesign\u201d mode and the prototype mode.</p><p>Any changes they make in the design mode (an updated icon, text, etc.) are automatically reflected in the prototype mode, which makes it easy to define interactive hotspots and transitions that make a mockup come to life.

Tesla\u2019s more popular supercharger stations can already get super busy during peak times \u2014 add in a sudden onslaught of Model 3 owners, and things might get crazy.

And in an attempt to vaccinate against the disease, said corporates are either acquiring, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/11/10/suddenly-every-company-is-becoming-a-venture-capitalist/\">investing in</a>, or incubating startups of their own.</p><p>The latest to hedge against innovator\u2019s dilemma is carmaker Jaguar Land Rover, which today is unveiling <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.inmotion.im/\">InMotion</a>, a separate \u201cinnovation\u201d company charged with building mobility apps and services that play to the strengths of its parent company\u2019s premium car brand.</p><p>The new Jaguar Land Rover \u201cspin out\u201d, which itself may eventually spin out startups from the products it creates, is essentially operating as a company within a company, and with the autonomy to innovate at a faster pace than is typical of the traditional car industry.</p><p>As Adrian Hallmark, Group Strategy Director for Jaguar Land Rover, tells TechCrunch, a new car is typically 3-4 years in the making and with a lifespan that sees it stay around for nearly a decade. In contrast, the digital world enables products to come to market in a matter of months not years, and it\u2019s within this context that InMotion is being given the freedom and financial support to try new ideas and see what works.</p><p>Initially those ideas \u2014 which Hallmark characterised as helping customers get from A to B more efficiently or in more premium ways, but stopped short of providing any further details on what exactly the team is already working on \u2014 are being generated within Jaguar Land Rover. However, moving forward InMotion plans to also reach out to the wider startup community for potential collaboration.</p><p>That led me to ask one simple question: Is InMotion a company builder, incubator or investor? The answer, says Hallmark, is a bit of all three.</p><p>Where\u2019s there\u2019s a good strategic fit with Jaguar Land Rover\u2019s existing customer base and brand, products and services developed by InMotion will likely remain in-house and continue to be solely supported by its parent company.</p><p>However, where an idea still has legs but isn\u2019t such a good fit with Jaguar Land Rover, there remains the possibility to spin it out independently, including taking external investment. In effect, that makes InMotion a business that aims to build new businesses.</p><p>Welcome to the fast lane, Jaguar Land Rover.</p>",

Maybe different startups would be motivated to apply, if they knew that the interviewing and deciding would be done by the HN community. Interesting things might happen, or they might not. We\u2019d have to try it and see.</em><br></p><p>So they\u2019re going to do just that, in a limited fashion. At least two startups will be chosen via \u201cApply HN\u201d posts, which will work like the existing \u201cShow HN\u201d \u2014 but moderation will be more strict (or less moderate, if you like) and YC entry officials will be scrutinizing the conversation. Gackle and Kevin Hale, who runs the Fellowship program, suggest critics \u201cbe nice.\u201d</p><p>Your submission should be very early stage, no investment, but ready to have the tires kicked. You should be ready to go full-time on it for eight weeks.</p><p>At the end of April, the submissions will be ranked by upvotes and the \u201cquality of discussion,\u201d (tiebreakers TBA). Chosen ideas or projects will join this summer\u2019s<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://fellowship.ycombinator.com/about/\">YC Fellowship</a>, which awards $20,000 (at the price of 1.5 percent equity) and the mentorship of experts at the accelerator (priceless).</p><p>It\u2019s unlikely anyone really thinks this will go off without a hitch \u2014 putting real money and opportunity in the hands of the hoi polloi rarely does \u2014 but $40,000 is a small investment for YC to find out whether this could be an interesting way to entice young, impressionable startups into their lair.</p><p>The discussion is ongoing at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11440627\">this HN thread</a>. Go be nice!</p>",

The updated application now features a bright blue navigation bar at the top of the screen with buttons to access chat, groups, settings and more. Meanwhile, in place of the bottom blue bar with separate buttons for composing new chats, search and making phone calls, there\u2019s now a new floating action button that appears instead at the bottom-right of the screen.</p><p>This button, when pressed, lets you take those common actions, including search, adding contacts, making a call, writing a message, and so on.</p><p>Material Design, by way of background, is the design language that Google first <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/25/google-unveils-new-cross-platform-design-language-material-design/\">introduced</a> back in 2014. The idea was to give Android apps a more universal look-and-feel, by way of various guidelines that encouraged bold colors, polished motion graphics and animations, intentional use of white spaces and more.</p><p>That being said, the Messenger for Android makeover itself is not overly dramatic, as it doesn\u2019t present an array of new features or functionality for end users to learn. It\u2019s more of a visual overhaul to the app with subtler changes that may even go unnoticed by irregular Messenger users.</p><p>The update was first <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10156717185705195&set=a.489597915194.389572.800665194&type=3&theater\">announced</a> on Facebook itself by Messenger head, David Marcus.</p><p>Addressing why the update took so long to arrive, he wrote that: \u201cAny major redesign of an essential app used by hundreds of millions of people around the world is painstakenly [sic] hard, and that\u2019s why we took every precaution to ensure you\u2019d truly enjoy this evolution.\u201d</p><p>Marcus also confirmed in the comments of his post that the update would be available to all users later today.</p><p>A number of Android users, however, already received the update as Facebook had been testing its release ahead of today\u2019s news. Leaks from January and February pointed to this redesign being in the works, though it was unclear at the time when all users would receive the update, as well.</p><p>For reference, below is the current version of Messenger, displaying the bottom blue bar and the white background for the top navigation.</p>",
